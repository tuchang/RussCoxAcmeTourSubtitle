00:00:01,001 --> 00:00:04,951
Welcome. This is a quick tour of Acme, a
text editor created by Rob Pike...

2
00:00:04,961 --> 00:00:06,991
almost 20 years ago as part of Plan 9.

3
00:00:07,001 --> 00:00:11,561
Although Rob created Acme on Plan 9,
Acme is now available on FreeBSD, Linux,

4
00:00:11,571 --> 00:00:15,231
OS X and other Unix systems as part of
Plan 9 from User Space.

5
00:00:16,001 --> 00:00:19,510
There is also a port of Acme to the
Inferno operating system which gives...

6
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:20,991
it a way to running on Windows.

7
00:00:21,001 --> 00:00:25,049
The video description has a link to a
page which points to downloads and...

8
00:00:25,059 --> 00:00:25,991
more information.

9
00:00:26,001 --> 00:00:29,958
For me, the distinguishing feature of
Acme is it works well alongside the...

10
00:00:29,968 --> 00:00:33,991
surrounding system instead of trying to
be a complete environment all by itself.

11
00:00:34,001 --> 00:00:38,141
Acme does not enjoy nearly the
popularity of editors like Emacs and...

12
00:00:38,151 --> 00:00:38,751
VI do,

13
00:00:39,001 --> 00:00:40,001
but it has a small dedicated following.

14
00:00:40,001 --> 00:00:45,001
When I had to switch to using Unix
workstations again in the early 2000's,

15
00:00:45,001 --> 00:00:49,001
I missed Acme so much that I ported all
Plan 9 user programs to Unix to get...

16
00:00:49,001 --> 00:00:50,231
it back.

17
00:00:50,001 --> 00:00:53,408
Acme creates an experience where text is
a dynamic thing and you can execute it,

18
00:00:53,418 --> 00:00:54,991
and assign it arbitrary meanings.

19
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:59,441
where plugin written in any language at
all can interact with Acme to control

20
00:00:59,451 --> 00:00:59,991
windows.

21
00:01:00,001 --> 00:01:02,854
The result is that you can keep using
the tools you have instead of having...

22
00:01:02,864 --> 00:01:03,991
to learn the whole new system.

23
00:01:04,001 --> 00:01:07,661
But you can still custom them to fit well into Acme.

24
00:01:08,001 --> 00:01:11,559
In this screencast I am going to try to
convey a few of what it is like to...

25
00:01:11,569 --> 00:01:11,991
use Acme.

26
00:01:12,001 --> 00:01:15,489
I am going to start with the basics and
build up to a short programming session...

27
00:01:15,499 --> 00:01:15,991
at the end.

28
00:01:16,001 --> 00:01:20,381
One final note before the content, I
sized the video to fit Youtube...

29
00:01:20,391 --> 00:01:21,991
large playing video mode exactly.

30
00:01:22,001 --> 00:01:25,421
If the screen text look fuzzy, please
switch to that mode.

31
00:01:29,001 --> 00:01:30,991
Because Acme was designed as part of
Plan 9,

32
00:01:31,001 --> 00:01:35,021
it is a graphical program not cursor
addressed and makes extensive use of

33
00:01:35,031 --> 00:01:35,631
the mouse.

34
00:01:36,001 --> 00:01:38,991
This screen you are looking at is a
small Acme screen.

35
00:01:39,001 --> 00:01:42,181
Its size fits exactly to Youtube 854 by
480 video box.

36
00:01:43,001 --> 00:01:44,991
Normally you use a larger display.

37
00:01:45,001 --> 00:01:48,781
I'd like to recommend to use fullscreen
as you see in the video.
